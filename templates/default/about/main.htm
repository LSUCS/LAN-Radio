    <h3>What?</h3>
    <span>
        LAN Radio is a democratic music player for LAN parties that allows everyone a fair say in what music is played. It supports music from sources such as Spotify and YouTube.
    </span>
    
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <span>
        Originally at LANs we used <a href="http://www.blicko.com/">Blicko</a>, however this was often unstable, and forced annoying social media interractions (such as forcing you to post on your Facebook page when you added or voted for a song).
    </span>
    
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <span>
        The web frontend of the system runs on a php framework written by myself. It's designed for a much larger site and is probably overkill for this use.<br />
        The backend of the system uses <a href="http://www.mopidy.com">Mopidy</a> music server, with some additional plugins written for YouTube, and to use a dynamic playlist.

    <h3>Who?</h3>
    <span>
        The system was designed and written by Michael Fiford (MetalMichael)
